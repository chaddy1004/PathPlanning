# PathPlanning
When discussing robot path planning algorithms, there are two basic techniques that are used as a starting point: Probablistic Road Map (PRM), and Rapidly exploring Random Trees (RRT).

Of course there  are other techniques, but I enjoy these two methods especially, since they were easy to understand, and personally help me understand graohs a lot better.

My hope with this repository is that the reader also may be able to explore how these algorithms work, and see them in action.

As a prologue, here are the two algorithms in action:

PRM, after it used A* to find the shortest path:

RRT, going from start to end by visiting each waypoints:
